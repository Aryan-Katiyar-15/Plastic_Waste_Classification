# Week-1
This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of plastic waste, contributing to better waste management solutions. Using the Waste Classification Dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data/data), the model identifies and categorizes waste into recyclable and organic categories.
