# Waste Classification Project

## Overview
This project is focused on classifying waste materials into two categories: **Organic** and **Recyclable**. The dataset used for this project contains images of different waste items, and the goal is to classify these items based on their category using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

The project follows a structured approach, with progress made in two stages:
- **Week 1**: Label visualization using a pie chart.
- **Week 2**: Model creation, training, and implementation of early stopping to prevent overfitting.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available on [Kaggle: Waste Classification Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data). This dataset contains images categorized as **Organic** and **Recyclable**, which are used for training the model.

## Project Structure

- **Week 1**: 
  - Visualized the distribution of labels (Organic and Recyclable) in the dataset using a pie chart.
  - Ensured that data was properly preprocessed, with each category being labeled and ready for model training.
  
- **Week 2**: 
  - Created a CNN model with multiple convolutional layers.
  - Applied data augmentation using `ImageDataGenerator`.
  - Implemented early stopping to avoid overfitting during model training.
  - Trained the model using the provided dataset and validated using a test set.

## Libraries Used
- **TensorFlow** for model building and training.
- **Keras** for deep learning components such as layers and callbacks.
- **OpenCV** for image preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib** for visualization (used for pie chart and image display).
- **Pandas** for data handling and management.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib pandas tqdm kaggle
```

## How to Run
1. Download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data) and store it in the proper directory.
2. Make sure that the dataset is extracted and correctly placed in the `/TRAIN` and `/TEST` folders.
3. Execute the code in a Python environment with TensorFlow and the required libraries.

```bash
python waste_classification.py
```

## Results
- **Week 1**: Successful creation of label visualization in the form of a pie chart.
- **Week 2**: Successful model training with early stopping and data augmentation.

## Improvements
- In Week 2, the project was enhanced by:
  - Creating a deeper CNN model for better accuracy.
  - Implementing early stopping to prevent overfitting during the training phase.
  - Including data augmentation to improve model generalization.

## Future Work
- Improving model accuracy by fine-tuning hyperparameters.
- Implementing advanced techniques such as Transfer Learning using pre-trained models.
- Expanding the dataset for better diversity and model performance.
